Learning Outcomes
-----------------

- The student will do a small experiment to show the proper use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) using `XMLHTTPRequest` or `fetch()`
- The student will learn to make a simple web component in JavaScript  

Part 1 - HTTP with JavaScript (40pts)
-------------------------------------

Make a page for your site as we did in the last assignment that is some experimental page for testing things. This page **does have to be linked into your navigation**, and it should have the filename `methodtest.html` The purpose of this page will be to test your ability to call endpoints using JavaScript and writing out the response back to the screen.

The following endpoints will be used:

- <https://httpbin.org/post>
- <https://httpbin.org/get>
- <https://httpbin.org/put>
- <https://httpbin.org/delete>

Create an HTML form with the following fields:

- `id` which will be a number for some fake record id
- `article_name` which will be a text field for some article you might write
- `article_body` which will be a `<textarea>` containing content of the article
- (this field will not be editable or potentially even displayed) date which should be the current date and time of the post generated by a JavaScript call to `new Date()`

Add in four (4) buttons `postBtn`, `getBtn`, `putBtn`, and `deleteBtn` which will perform the corresponding HTTP methods and sending them to the end-points above. In other words postBtn would read the data and send it to the <https://httpbin.org/post> end point.

**Note:** If you were a stickler for details some of these fields don't make sense in all cases. You are free to add such logic in for limiting fields depending on what you are doing for bonus points.

Your code will issue the appropriate requests with either the `XMLHttpRequest` or the `fetch` API. If you want to do both and have a radio or select control to pick which to use you may do so for bonus points.

The data coming back from the end point will be a JSON response. You should read that response and then put it back into the page into a `<output>` tag with the `id` value of 'response'. You must format the result in a nice manner using HTML and/ or CSS to create a readable format.  

We will leave this up to you to design to give this question a bit of subjectivity. You may consult code online for ideas, but a simple JSON to HTML table script is not difficult and there is no reason for you to try to ponder that from scratch. Other possibilities using lists or even `<textarea>` or even using CSS property of `white-space: pre` with tabs might work. Be creative in the solution rather than brute forcing custom code. Do this wrong and waste precious time.  

Point distribution : 5pts per method (20pts total), 5pts for form and HTML usage, 10pts for response output, 5pts for code organization (proper use of let, modules, etc.) that would follow ideas previously presented in homework.

Part 2 - Simple Web Component (20pts)
-------------------------------------

For this section we will be creating a simple web component called `<button-count>`

This web component will have one feature:

- It will keep track of and display how many times it has been clicked

A video demonstration is shown below:

**Requirements** when building this web component:

- This part of the homework should be its own page with the filename of **webcomponent.html**
- All of the code to make `button-count` work must be written _inside_ of a class titled **_ButtonCount_** inside a file titled **_ButtonCount.js_**
- The element `button-count` must be defined in the custom elements registry (this should be a single line of code underneath your class)
- `button-count` must be an [autonomous custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements#autonomous_custom_elements), meaning it should extend **_HTMLElement_**, not any other element
- All of the markup inside of `button-count` must be inside of the _Shadow DOM_ (i.e. attached to a shadow root)
- As long as the above is requirements are met, the exact implementation of how it works is up to you.

- [What is the Shadow DOM?](https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-web-components/#aa-shadow-dom) (the linked section is helpful, but worth reading the whole page)
- [How do I use the Shadow DOM?](https://css-tricks.com/encapsulating-style-and-structure-with-shadow-dom/)

Point Distribution: Element defined in the custom element registry (4 points), all code for `button-count` contained within ButtonCount class (4 points), the Shadow DOM was successfully used (4 points), `button-count` behaves as shown in video (8 points)

Part 3 - Using React / Vue (Extra Credit)
-----------------------------------------

If you have experience with React, Vue, or another framework and work like to remake this component in that framework - we will award some extra credit. Note: While you may choose to remake this component in as many frameworks as you like, we will only award extra credit for a max of 2 frameworks.

If you choose to complete this part, host these buttons on a page with the filename of **extracredit.html**

Extra Credit Amount: TBD

**Important Note:** Please make the submission on Gradescope.

**Your Submission Should Include: (also read the update below)**

- **README.md** with your name, PID, link to your solution (your Netlify URL) and any notes you think that will help the grader to make sense of your solution
- **link.md** which contains hosted links to:
  - Part 1 of this assignment
  - Part 2 of this assignment
  - Part 3 of this assignment (if completed)
- All of the files you created for this assignment, which are:
  - **methodtest.html**
  - **webcomponent.html**
  - **ButtonCount.js**
  - **(optional) extracredit.html**
  - Any other JS files as well

**UPDATE** as mentioned on slack;

![:rotating_light:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f6a8.png) **NOTE** : For Homework 5 ![:rotating_light:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/13.0/apple-medium/1f6a8.png)

1. Please **include clickable links to parts 1 and 2** in the top nav bar (or some other visible location)
2. **DO NOT upload** files like  `.DS_Store` , or any other “meta” or build output files. If you’re having problems I think gradescope will let you select & delete files after upload; alternatively copy only files that you want to upload to a new folder and submit that to gradescope).

**NOTE:**

- Please make sure ALL of your files are named correctly and remember - you MUST use a new Netlify project / link for HW5
