// All of the code to make button-count work must be written inside of a class titled ButtonCount inside a file titled ButtonCount.js
// The element button-count must be defined in the custom elements registry (this should be a single line of code underneath your class)
// button-count must be an autonomous custom element, meaning it should extend HTMLElement, not any other element
// All of the markup inside of button-count must be inside of the Shadow DOM (i.e. attached to a shadow root)
// As long as the above is requirements are met, the exact implementation of how it works is up to you.

class ButtonCount {}
